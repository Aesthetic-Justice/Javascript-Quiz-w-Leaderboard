# Javascript Quiz(Now in Javascript flavour)

## Description

the purpose of this application is to both test both the user and the creator's knowledge and mastery with Javascript. Attached to this repository is an app which queries the user with up to ten skill-testing questions relating to Javascript and its varying nuances. The user is given a set time limit of 75 seconds to complete the questionnaire, with incorrect questions docking their time limit by 10 seconds each. Users unable to complete the quiz in time are given zero points, with one point being given for each remaining second after the quiz is complete.

Users who complete the quiz are given the option to enter their initials and have their score recorded for later comparison. This however is done locally within the browser, so comparing your score against others online is sadly unavailable at the time.
